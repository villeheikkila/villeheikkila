  Hi! I'm Ville, a software developer and tech enthusiast  ðŸš€

<br />

I'm a software developer and computer science student from the University of Helsinki. I like to constantly learn new skills and find better ways to solve problems. As software developer, I enjoy challenging myself with new technologies, practices and patterns and to hone my craft. I strive to be a generalist with good understanding of the entire stack from the databases to the frontend without forgetting the design, testing and deployment. As a computer science student, I want to deepen my understanding on the low-level details about programming and operating systems. I pride myself in having good understanding of the technologies I use.
